Cancer cells are abnormal cells that avoid apoptosis and divide and proliferate in an uncontroled manner.This misregulated growth is caused by damaged DNA and a series of mutationsthat transform a normal cell into a malignant one.  <br>While most of the lab's research focuses on basic science questions, thesecan potentially shed insight into cancer.  Understanding on how a <a href="calculation"> cell processes signals </a> can help understand how and whycancer cells uncontrolable proliferate.  Understanding how sequence variation <a href="geneticgenomics.html"> alters the regulatory network </a> and how a sequence of such alterations manifest in <a href="evofitness.html"> fitness and new phenotypes</a> can help shed light on how cancer progresses and invades into other tissues. We will take the tools and models developed in the other research areas in our laband apply these to cancer biology.  We focus on two key directions:<ul><li> The NIH has launched a <a href="http://cancergenome.nih.gov/index.asp"> CancerAtlas project </a>, a comprehensive and coordinated effort to sequence and profilethe expression of thousands of tumor samples.  Our lab will use the methods we developto analyze the information flow from sequence variation, through gene expresion to phenotype to analyze this data to find commonalities and points for potential treatmentfrom this data.<li>  In continuation of our collaboration with the <a href="http://proteomics.stanford.edu/nolan/"> Nolan lab </a> to build a landscape map of normal cell signaling across different cell types and stimuli, we will use to Nolanlab's ability to interogate primary cells, to derive patient specific signaling maps. These will be compared to the landscape data to derive a patient specific signature forthat cancer.  The Nolan lab has had <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=pubmed&cmd=Retrieve&dopt=AbstractPlus&list_uids=15260991&query_hl=2&itool=pubmed_docsum">previous success </a> in correlating these patient specific signatures with clinical outcome.Our current efforts aim to gain a more global and causitive understanding of the links betweenthe cancer signatures and their associated clinical outcome.</ul>   </td>	</table></body></html>
